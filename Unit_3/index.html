  <hr>
  <p>I’ve spent the last decade+ plus bringing new ideas to life.  <br>
  <br>
  During my 15-year Intel career, I brought innovative, user-centered capabilities to Intel products.  From delivering mobile concept devices, to helping deliver Intel’s first branded consumer platform, to conceptualizing/storyboarding the next wave (2017+) of mobile experiences, I gravitated toward the new and risky projects.<br>
  <br>
  Post-Intel, I co-founded a startup bringing a new 'dine-and-play' sports entertainment experience to life.  I built the business plan, led the development of game prototypes, and delivered comprehensive user-experience-based requirements for core software development.<br>
  <br>
  Most importantly, I’m skilled at the "block-and-tackle" work required to turn ideas into reality.  Whether it’s building a business plan, refining ideas through market research, developing thoughtful product requirements, collaborating with engineering teams, or even getting great press once its launched, I’ve done it -- successfully.<br>
  <br>
  More specifically, I can help with:
  <ul>
  	<li>Concept ideation and development</li>
    <li>New product development</li>
  	<li>Business strategy and business plan creation
  	<li>Market research and user insights</li>
  	<li>Product requirements development and documentation</li>
 	  <li>Technology sourcing and evaluation</li>
  	<li>Messaging and collateral development</li>
  </ul></p>

  <h2 id="Pageclose">I look forward to working with you!</h2>
