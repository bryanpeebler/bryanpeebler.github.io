		<h1>Volunteer Opportunities:  The Gift of Time</h1>
		<p>Volunteering is an amazing way to help the children served by Folsom's Hope!  It doesn't take much -- just an hour or so a week -- to change the life of an at-risk child.<br><br>  There are several ways you can help, including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>1:1 mentoring during elementary and middle school lunchtimes</li>
			<li>After-school tutoring and homework help</li>
			<li>Providing in-class help at Folsom Lake High School</li>
			<li>Joining the Pray Team, on most Mondays, to pray for our schools and the surrounding community</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<p> If you'd like to learn more about volunteer opportunities, contact Salwa Kasabian.  We are happy to help guide you to the right opportunity!</p>
		<br>
		<p class="ital"> Note: Some volunteer opportunities require fingerprinting and a TB test.  The Folsom's Hope team can help facilitate this process. </p>

		<p>I've had the opportunity to work with Folsom's Hope kids for several years now, in both the mentoring and tutoring programs.  Seeing how these kids progress with just a little bit of love and help has been amazing.  I've learned as much from the kids as they've learned from me!!!  <br> -- Sonja S.</p>
