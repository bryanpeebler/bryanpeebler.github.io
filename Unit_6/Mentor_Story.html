		<h1>Stories of Hope: Jacob and Me</h1>
		<img class="picturebox3" width=50% src="images/Bryan_pic2.jpg">
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold">When I first met Jacob* I wasn’t sure what to expect.  </span>I know a little about his background — that he had lost his Mom and that his dad was not in his life…  that his aunt had taken him in, and moved to Folsom to get him into Blanche Sprentz elementary... and that he was considered one of the more “at-risk” kids in the entire program.<br>
		<br>
		Given everything that had happened to him before the first grade, I thought maybe he’d be sad, or angry, or socially difficult.<br>  
		<br>
		But when I met Jacob, I was amazed at what a smart, funny, delightful little boy he was!<br>
		<br>
		<span style="font-weight: bold">We clicked almost immediately</span> — Jacob told me all about his favorite superheroes (he loves Spider Man) and we talked about his favorite video games (he loves Sonic the Hedgehog and ).  He also told me, very matter of factly, that his Mom was dead and that she was an angel in heaven.  That almost broke my heart.  But I told him that I had also lost my Mom a few years ago, and that maybe his Mom and my Mom were hanging out together in heaven.  And that seemed to help (both of us).<br>
		<br>
		<span style="font-weight: bold">Since that day, our relationship has grown.</span>  I’ve learned that Jacob is a talented artist (he drew me a great picture of Sonic that hangs in my office), that he has a “girlfriend” (a little girl in his class), and that he loves professional wrestling (he’s a big fan of John Cena).  And we’ve bonded over games of Checkers, Monopoly, Jenga and Ping Pong during our lunches together.   He doesn’t talk much about his Mom, but I know there will be a day when he needs to process what happened to her — and I hope to be there for him during that time.<br>
		<br>
		One Sunday last summer we invited Jacob (through his Aunt) to come to Church with our family.  We were so excited when his Aunt agreed to let him come with us!  Since that time, my family (we have two young boys, one of whom is Jacob’s age) has built a relationship with his family.  And Jacob has become friends with my boys.  <span style="font-weight: bold">I love listening to Jacob and my boys in the backseat on the way to the park, debating about who’s the best superhero!</span><br>
		<br>
		I don’t know where our mentoring relationship will take us over the next few years.  But I know that Jacob has many difficult challenges ahead of him — and I am honored and blessed to have the opportunity to be there for him.  And I know that any love and guidance I can give him how will ripple through the rest of his life.<br>
		<br>
		<span style="font-weight: bold">It really is true:  A small amount of time — an hour or so a week — can make all the difference!</span><br>
		<br>
		Jacob is truly an amazing kid — I can’t wait to see what life has in store from him!!!.<br>
