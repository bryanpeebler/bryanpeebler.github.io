		<h1>Kindness: The Common Denominator</h1>

		<p class="quote_header">Heather Robinson overcame a turbulent childhood and is now a volunteer in Folsom’s Hope’s Peer Tutoring program—a former at-risk child now helping change the lives of other at-risk children. Heather is an English major at Folsom Lake College, and she wrote her story for the school’s Falconry Art Journal.</p>

		<p><span class="highlight_text">Learning math makes little girls bilingual,” </span>said my sixth grade teacher Ms. Trujillo, as I wiped tears off my face and onto my dirty jeans. “You worked hard to learn this other language. You are smart. Math makes you beautiful, mija.”<br>
		<br>
		To an eleven-year-old, mostly ignored by her family, with dirt under her fingernails, uncombed hair and painfully aware that her school clothes hadn’t been washed in a week, <span class="highlight_text">this teacher’s attention was like bathing in kindness and sunshine.</span> And although I did not become bilingual in math, I became bilingual in love and learned to appreciate multiculturalism.<br>
		<br>
		Ms. Trujillo was Native/Spanish/Mexican American. She wore lots of bright colors, long dresses that flowed below her knees—which twirled up a swish of perfumed air whenever she passed my desk—and layers and layers of turquoise necklaces, bracelets and rings. <span class="highlight_text">She was generous with smiles, tough on homework deadlines, and from that day forward always called me “mija.” </span>A term of endearment, mija is Spanish slang short for “mi hija” which means “my daughter.”<br>
		<br>
		<span class="highlight_text">That day I was in tears and Ms. Trujillo called me her smart, beautiful daughter,</span> I had turned in my homework assignment with holes in it, literally. The night before I had spent three hours, which to an eleven-year-old feels like three years, trying to complete the math fractions homework without help, guidance or a calculator and I had erased my answers so many times I had worn holes in the paper. “Please see me during recess,” she said when I turned my worn-out homework paper in.<br>
		<br>
		I knew I was in trouble. See the teacher during recess? Glorious, fun-filled, freedom-ride recess spent in doors with my teacher whose raised eyebrow at the suggestion we spend this time together was like hearing your name being called over the school’s intercom system requesting your presence in the principal’s office. “Ok,” I mumbled and slumped back to my desk. <br>
		<br>
		The next 90 minutes of class were a blur while I contemplated my fate as a student expelled, outcast and ostracized for daring to turn in a homework paper with holes is it. “Did you do this work?” she asked when we were finally alone. “Yes,” I answered while I analyzed my shoes. “Why are there holes in the paper? Are you sure you didn’t borrow another person’s paper and re-write the answers in your handwriting?” What? I had no idea what my teacher was asking but with tears in my eyes I answered, “No, I’m not sure, but if you multiply the bottom numbers by two so they are the same number then it’s what you said was a common denominator and makes fractions you can add and subtract.” <br>
		<br>
		Ms. Trujillo lowered her eyes, sat down at her desk and opened the drawer where she kept the pink slips she used to send students to the office and said, “Learning math makes little girls bilingual. You worked hard to learn this other language. <span class="highlight_text">You are smart. Math makes you beautiful, mija. Please take this stack of new paper and put it in your desk. I will always make sure you have extra paper in your desk which you can also take home with you. </span>Go join recess.”<br>
		<br>
		I never did become bilingual in math, but I am math competent and to this day I have a great affinity for long dresses, turquoise, homework deadlines, learning about Native/Spanish/Mexican American heritage and stacks of new, unworn paper. Whenever I hear the word “mija,” I smile and know my love of education is bilingual thanks to Ms. Trujillo.</p>

		<h2>A Volunteer's Perspective</h2>
		<p>I've had the opportunity to work with Folsom's Hope kids for several years now, in both the mentoring and tutoring programs.  Seeing how these kids progress with just a little bit of love and help has been amazing.  I've learned as much from the kids as they've learned from me!!!  <br><br> -- Sonja S., Folsom's Hope Volunteer</p>
