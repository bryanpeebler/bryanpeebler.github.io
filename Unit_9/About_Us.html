		<h1>Why We Do This</h1>
		<img class="picturebox3" src="images/KidsPic.png">
		<p>Folsom is a prosperous city where family, community, service and generosity are strongly held values. <span class="highlight_text">But in the midst of this prosperity there is also great need.</span> Families are broken. Parents are caught in the grip of destructive behavior. And children bear the consequence.<br>
		<br>
		<span class="highlight_text">When a child lives in turmoil, just getting through the day is a monumental effort</span> — and things like schoolwork, learning, reading, recreation, nutrition and even basic hygiene (things most of us take for granted in our families) become an afterthought.<br>
		<br>
		Without intervention, these negative early experiences shape a child’s identity well into adulthood. <span class="highlight_text">"I experienced something bad" becomes "I AM something bad." </span> The cycle repeats itself, and the dysfunction passes from generation to generation. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="highlight_text"> But it doesn’t have to be this way.</span><br>
		<br>
		Research shows—and our own experiences affirm—that <span class="highlight_text">caring, consistent, one-on-one attention can have a transformative effect on the lives of struggling children.</span><br>
		<br>
		And so Folsom’s Hope is doing just that: mentoring, tutoring, supporting, encouraging and nurturing at-risk students—elementary, middle and high school—right here in our own city.
