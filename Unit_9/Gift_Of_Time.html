		<h1>Stories of Hope: The Simple Gift of Time</h1>
		<img class="picturebox3b" src="images/tutor_pic.png">
		<p>Although each story at Folsom’s Hope is unique, many begin in the very same way.<br>
			<br>
			<span class="highlight_text">It starts with a child, in need of someone to invest in him or her. </span> It may be a child who is stumbling over obstacles placed in their path by circumstances far beyond their control. Possibly financial hardships experienced by the family; an unstable home life flavored by emotional, physical or substance abuse; mental or physical struggles experienced by the child or parents… or a child simply feeling the unyielding weight of fear, loneliness, uncertainty, or need.<br>
			<br>
			<span class="highlight_text">But then the story takes a turn</span> with the introduction of a new character. One person, recognizing the potential of relationship, willing to step outside of his or her conventional life to give the simple gift of time—one lunch hour, once a week.<br>
			<br>
			<span class="highlight_text">A lunch date is set.</span> One cautious child is introduced to one willing, but sometimes nervous, adult. On the first day, it’s hard to tell whose stomach corrals more butterflies. It starts simply, shy small talk and stories over sandwiches. A nervous giggle here and there, and a connection over upcoming movies and video games. <span class="highlight_text">As the weeks progress, the relationship builds;</span> the adult offering a consistent presence and a listening ear, and the child relaxing into this sacred space that welcomes discussions about dreams and fears and struggles and hopes. This lunch date, originally met with trepidation, now becomes a favorite weekly highlight for both of them.<br>
			<br>
			<span class="highlight_text"">A new chapter frequently forms as the relationship naturally grows </span>beyond its initial boundaries, and the mentor has the opportunity to meet the child’s parents and family. Maybe it’s at a school event or weekend outing… however the paths cross, <span class="highlight_text">oftentimes the seeds of relationships can’t help but sprout there, too.</span> And just as initial conversations with the child have led to discovering ways to navigate struggles in academics or social situations, deeper discussions with the parent may lead to uncovering the underlying needs that are impacting the family as a whole.<br>
			<br>
			<span class="highlight_text">And now, the same program that first matched the child with a mentor often expands to help address the wider needs of the entire family.</span> It may come in many forms: job training and assistance, résumé workshops, parenting classes, counseling resources, support networks, food and clothing programs, afterschool tutoring and care—or simply a welcoming environment that offers what they need most. <span slass="highlight_text">Hope.</span><br>
			<br>
			The stories of individuals and families that are touched by Folsom’s Hope are endless, but each is rooted in the simplest of beginnings. The cornerstone of every story is a single step, taken in faith, to begin and nurture a relationship with another individual in need. <span class="highlight_text">The very heart of Folsom’s Hope is relationship building… </span> because it is only when we act in relationship with one another that we can truly offer what is desired most by us all: a feeling of community, a sense of belonging, and a future of hope.</p>

		<h2>A Volunteer's Perspective</h2>
		<p>I have been involved with Folsom’s Hope for several years, after God called me to do more to help others.  It has been time incredibly well spent!   Seeing children thrive when they get one-on-one attention is very fulfilling.  Folsom’s Hope fills such an important need in these children’s lives! <br><br> -- Sonya S., Folsom's Hope Volunteer</p>
