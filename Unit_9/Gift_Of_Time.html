		<h1>Stories of Hope: The Simple Gift of Time</h1>
		<img class="picturebox3b" src="images/Boy_Pic.png">
		<p>Although each story at Folsom’s Hope is unique, many begin in the very same way.<br>
			<br>
			<span class="highlight_text">It starts with a child, in need of someone to invest in him or her. </span> It may be a child who is stuggling with circumstances far beyond their control. Possibly financial hardships experienced by the family; an unstable home life;  or a child simply feeling the unyielding weight of fear, loneliness, uncertainty, or need.<br>
			<br>
			<span class="highlight_text">But then the story takes a turn.</span>  One person, willing to step outside of his or her conventional life, decides to give the simple gift of time—one lunch hour, once a week.<br>
			<br>
			On the first day, it’s hard to tell whose stomach has more butterflies. It starts simply, shy small talk and stories over sandwiches -- then a connection over upcoming movies and video games. <span class="highlight_text">As the weeks progress, the relationship builds;</span> the adult offers a consistent presence and a listening ear, and the child relaxes into this sacred, trusted space. <br>
			<br>
			<span class="highlight_text"">A new chapter often forms when a mentor meets the child’s family.</span>  Just as conversations with the child have uncovered ways to navigate struggles in academics or social situations, deeper discussions with the parent uncover the underlying needs of the whole family.<br>
			<br>
			<span class="highlight_text">And now, the same program that first matched the child with a mentor often expands to help address the wider needs of the entire family.</span> It may come in many forms: job training and assistance, résumé workshops, parenting classes, counseling resources, food and clothing programs, or after-school tutoring.<br>
			<br>
			The stories of individuals and families that are touched by Folsom’s Hope are endless, but each is rooted in the simplest of beginnings. The cornerstone of every story is a single step, taken in faith, to begin and nurture a relationship with another individual in need. <span class="highlight_text">The heart of Folsom’s Hope is relationship building… </span> because it is only when we act in relationship with one another that we can truly offer what is desired most by us all: a feeling of community, a sense of belonging, and a future of hope.</p>

		<h2>A Volunteer's Perspective</h2>
		<p>I have been involved with Folsom’s Hope for several years, after God called me to do more to help others.  It has been time incredibly well spent!   Seeing children thrive when they get one-on-one attention is very fulfilling.  Folsom’s Hope fills such an important need in these children’s lives! <br><br> -- Sonya S., Folsom's Hope Volunteer</p>
